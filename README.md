# Library
A collection of books that I have read or want to read that are in some way related to data science, software engineering, machine learning, and so on with a few books sprinkled in that have been tangentially beneficial to my journey in the aforementioned fields.

Books are organized into the following categories:

\* *denotes I have read the book in its entirety.*

\~ *denotes I have read parts of the book.*

\^ *denotes I am currently reading the book.*
